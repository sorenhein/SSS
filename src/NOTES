Plays goes into Combination
- next -> nextPlay
- size -> sizePlay
- resize -> resizePlay
- reset -> resetPlay

PlayEntry
- Goes away as such
- Combination.nextPlay just selects the next play, internally
- update methods updates that next play

In Combination
- The plays go in a tree structure




------

* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values

* CombEntry -> Combination?
* In Combination, generate all tricks
  - Some dist's are impossible because E or W known to be void
  - And some because of HCP or other limitations
  - Set up the tree
  - Have a dist vector that corresponds to next-level dists
  - Know which ones are possible
  - Know which cards correspond to next-level cards (and ranks)
