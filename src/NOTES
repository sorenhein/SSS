Map the holding3 at the end of a play to a * combination.
- Ranks must also log the number of remaining cards

Get the distribution at the beginning of a combination and pass it
in to strategize().



strategies/
  Strategy: For now just a flat vector
  Strategies: For now a collection of Strategy

Plays goes into Combination
- next -> nextPlay
- size -> sizePlay
- resize -> resizePlay
- reset -> resetPlay


------

* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values

* CombEntry -> Combination?
* In Combination, generate all tricks
  - Some dist's are impossible because E or W known to be void
  - And some because of HCP or other limitations
  - Set up the tree
  - Have a dist vector that corresponds to next-level dists
  - Know which ones are possible
  - Know which cards correspond to next-level cards (and ranks)
