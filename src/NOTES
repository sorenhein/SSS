In Plays, or maybe in Combination

Becomes more complicated when we have to keep track of:

- Winning ranks for NS
- Winning plays/strategies such as "cash ace"
  - Sometimes NS have several ways to reach its optimum; keep them all
- Noting the inequalities on EW plays that are needed to stabilize
  an NS strategy

------

* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values

* CombEntry -> Combination?
* In Combination, generate all tricks
  - Some dist's are impossible because E or W known to be void
  - And some because of HCP or other limitations
  - Set up the tree
  - Have a dist vector that corresponds to next-level dists
  - Know which ones are possible
  - Know which cards correspond to next-level cards (and ranks)
