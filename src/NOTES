~ 3000 sec for 1..12

* Time each card length run
* Only up to 11 for now?
* In canonical(), can use .at instead of string
* map<char, char> instead of <string, string>
* Could have vector<char> indexed by index in CARD_NAMES
* Ranks should just be size cards (set once)
* We note the running rank but don't resize all the time
* 3* could be x + (x << 1) or += (x << 1)
* cards can be fixed-size at maximum, so no push_back
* Use arrays, not vectors
* Multi-thread? One rank per thread.

* Doesn't parse -n A -s void ?
