- Moved canonical to the new way of doing it
- Remove full2reduced vectors after this fix
- Put the fullCount vectors inside the north/south/opps structs?
- Better name than RankInfo3, maybe FullRankInfo
- Get rid of Ranks.cpp
- Get rid of RankInfo
- Rename RankInfo to ReducedRankInfo
- RankInfo goes inside Ranks2.cpp
- dominates() can take PositionInfo's as arguments
- play output should use full ranks


Optimizations
- If LHO void, RHO is more restricted
- If opps play Q and we have KJ (so 1 rank in between), always prefer K to J.

- canonical: 
  - c2c looks wrong?



* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values

* CombEntry -> Combination?
* Add rank = 0 for void, shift the others up
* In Combination, generate all tricks
  - First naively
  - Then properly
  - Count the difference
  - side, card1..4
  - End up with new comb, new dist bit vector
  - Also, some dist's are impossible because E or W known to be void
  - And some because of HCP or other limitations
  - Set up the tree
  - Have a dist vector that corresponds to next-level dists
  - Know which ones are possible
  - Know which cards correspond to next-level cards (and ranks)
