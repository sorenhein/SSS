* CombEntry -> Combination?
* Debug Distribution
* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values
* Add rank = 0 for void, shift the others up
* Make Distributions, using holding2 (binary, not trinary)
* In Combination, generate all tricks
  - First naively
  - Then properly
  - Count the difference
  - side, card1..4
  - End up with new comb, new dist bit vector
  - Also, some dist's are impossible because E or W known to be void
  - And some because of HCP or other limitations
  - Set up the tree
  - Have a dist vector that corresponds to next-level dists
  - Know which ones are possible
  - Know which cards correspond to next-level cards (and ranks)
