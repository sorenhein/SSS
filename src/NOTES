plays gets a tree structure.  Ranks gets simplified accordingly.

Distribution should know which of the distributions are still feasible
if cards 1, 2 are played.  (The rotation remains a somewhat open issue.)
This would be a vector of numbers, and probably a fixed size so also
the number with the actual size.

------

* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values

* CombEntry -> Combination?
* In Combination, generate all tricks
  - Some dist's are impossible because E or W known to be void
  - And some because of HCP or other limitations
  - Set up the tree
  - Have a dist vector that corresponds to next-level dists
  - Know which ones are possible
  - Know which cards correspond to next-level cards (and ranks)
