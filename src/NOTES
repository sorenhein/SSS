Bug in Plays, logging:
- The plays are in fact not in order.
- Instead they are in order for LHO void, and then in order for rest
- So we need something else in Plays to detect previously seen starts,
  both for lead, LHO, pard and RHO(?)

Optimization in Ranks:
- With AQ / - missing KJ, on Ace never drop King (partner will show
  out and the lead was the top card)
- With KJ / - missing AQ, on K never play Q (partner HAS shown out,
  so always win trick)
- Maybe in 4th hand when NS are down to <= 1 card after this trick,
  KJ with AQxx outstanding for example (6/548).

Plays become more complicated when we have to keep track of:

- Winning ranks for NS
- Winning plays/strategies such as "cash ace"
  - Sometimes NS have several ways to reach its optimum; keep them all
- Noting the inequalities on EW plays that are needed to stabilize
  an NS strategy

------

* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values
