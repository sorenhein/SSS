If play gets accessed from updateHoldings using play.updateHoldings(),
then play is completely encapsulated in Ranks.

plays get stored in outside method so it's easier to turn into a
tree later.

Space for plays comes from Combination.

------

* Distribution::limit, using a struct that Control returns
  - We will fail for now on some HCP values

* CombEntry -> Combination?
* In Combination, generate all tricks
  - Some dist's are impossible because E or W known to be void
  - And some because of HCP or other limitations
  - Set up the tree
  - Have a dist vector that corresponds to next-level dists
  - Know which ones are possible
  - Know which cards correspond to next-level cards (and ranks)
